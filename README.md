## Disclaimer

**DISCLAIMER: You will probably disagree with "simple", "clean", "reusable". I don't care what you think.** I'm OK you have your own view on it. Don't expect me to conform with yours, nor do I think there is :sparkles: *one true way* :sparkles: but I'm open to hear your open-minded suggestions of what you think works better, as long as you can respect that I'll have a different view maybe :smiley: and I don't think that makes either of us "right", nor do I think that either of us need to pretend the other is "wrong" if we disagree :heart: We can simply disagree :smiley:
