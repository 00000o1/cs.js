// the sorts
  - implement quickselect (and another O(n) selection algorithm)

// skiplist
  - improve performance (index awareness has overhead, maybe increased 3x our times)
  - handle deletion better -- delete the levels if last node
  - prevent levels growing up if there's only one node in level below
  - add other methods (like reverse? root and terminus and double linked)
