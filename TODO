// singly linked list (for study only)
- reverse algorithm ( stack/recursive and iterative )

// skiplist
  - prevent levels growing up if there's only one node in level below
  - add other methods (like reverse? root and terminus and double linked)
  - add indexability (and getByIndex)
  - handle deletion better -- delete the levels if last node
