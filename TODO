// heap 
  - fix leaf change on deletion (we delete the last leaf, and move leaf to the deleted node, after its sift down)

// skiplist
  - prevent levels growing up if there's only one node in level below
  - add other methods (like reverse?)
  - add indexability (and getByIndex)
  - handle deletion better -- delete the levels if last node
