// the sorts
  - implement quickselect (and another O(n) selection algorithm)

// skiplist
  - handle deletion better -- delete the levels if last node
  - prevent levels growing up if there's only one node in level below (keep a max height on the skiplist and only allow grow by 1 level at a time)
  - add other methods (like reverse? root and terminus and double linked)
