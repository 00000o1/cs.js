TO DO
- orders. Hasse diagrams. This stuff is fascinating. (see: https://archive.is/wip/nP1Oh)
- equivalence classes of integers under partitions as determined by binary representation
  - let's do a topolgocial sort by these classes. See NOTES in the 01 directory
  - I want to put this into some graph representation to really see the patterns come out. And some graphs (maybe in grids) with colors and numbers, etc. I need to think about, and I think it will be fun to think about the best way to arrange the data to really let the patterns fly out.
  - second to this investigate the partitions given by and the equivalence classes of numbers in 
    irrational (base phi, base e, etc (c.f. irradix)) radix representations
  - third consider what if we change partition definition, or allow 0s to be included in partitions?
- kth permutation of a string / ordered set. That means we can define any sequence in terms of
S (ordered set or string) and k (the kth permutation) as well as a partial order p.
- question: if you have a box of N pairs of socks, how many socks do you have to draw until you get a match with probability p? (might be related to birthday spacings). Now, what if you throw a spanner in the works with K unmatched (lost / forgotten) half-pairs? Now, what if you throw another spanner in the works with a function Z(S,S) => R0,1 that fuzzily compares socks, so you no longer have an exact (0,1) match but a fuzzy continuum of match-iness, what's the relationship between p, N, and Z?

DOING
- equivalence classes of integers under partitions as determined by binary representation

PARTIALLY DONE 
  PARTIALLY DONE - what's the connection between bit sequences, repeated squarings, reconstructing a number via a sequence of doublings and additions, and deconstructing via the reverse
    - see: commit 58d617d7b50c868a6d2153052b8e95492e04f63f
    - still to do: really come up with THE set of equations and algorithms for all this stuff
    the connections, flesh it all out. I just feel like 
    there's something there to be obtained in the clarity about this.
