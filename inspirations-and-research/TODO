- equivalence classes of integers under partitions as determined by binary representation
  - second to this investigate the partitions given by and the equivalence classes of numbers in 
  irrational (base phi, base e, etc (c.f. irradix)) radix representations
- kth permutation of a string / ordered set. That means we can define any sequence in terms of
S (ordered set or string) and k (the kth permutation) as well as a partial order p.
