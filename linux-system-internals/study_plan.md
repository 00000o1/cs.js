# Study Plan for Linux System Internals

One thing I think I should study things based on the /proc filesystem. Go through that and read the sections that seem important. This main trunk then branches off in many smaller branches that include system calls and APIS (read(2), execve(2), epoll(2), etc)

Another thing I should study is:
- ptrace (the call)
- strace (the command)
- gdb
